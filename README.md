## 🎯 Problem Statement

In the competitive banking sector, understanding which customers are most likely to subscribe to financial products is critical. This project uses call center data to build a machine learning model that predicts **fixed deposit subscription**, helping to improve conversion rates and customer targeting.

---

## 📊 Data Overview

The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics (age, job, marital status, education)
- Call and contact details (contact type, duration, last contact day/month)
- Campaign information (number of contacts, previous outcome)
- **Target variable**: `y` (Yes/No - whether the customer subscribed)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Customers with longer call durations are more likely to subscribe.
- Retired and student segments show higher subscription rates.
- A successful previous campaign increases current subscription likelihood.
